# 🏃 Endure-O-Matic

A lap planning and tracking tool for team endurance events.

## What is it?

If your team is entering an endurance event — like [Endure 24](https://endure24.co.uk/) — you need to figure out who's running when, for how long, and keep track of it all on the day. That's what Endure-O-Matic does.

- **Plan your rotation** — Add your team members, set estimated lap times, and see a predicted schedule for the entire event.
- **Track on the day** — Mark laps as started and completed. The schedule updates automatically based on real times.
- **Share with the team** — Everyone gets a link. No logins, no accounts. Works on phones, even with patchy signal.
- **Keep spectators in the loop** — Share a read-only link so friends and family can follow your progress.

## How it works

1. Pick your event (e.g. Endure 24)
2. Create a team and add your members
3. Share the link with your team
4. On race day, tap "Start" and "Complete" as each runner heads out and comes back

The app predicts when each person will run next, accounting for fatigue as the event goes on. Everything syncs in real time between everyone's phones — and works offline too, syncing back up when you get signal again.

## Quick start

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
